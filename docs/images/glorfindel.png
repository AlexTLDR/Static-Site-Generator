I cannot create a valid PNG file through text output, as PNG files are binary format files that require specific binary headers and compressed image data. PNG files cannot be created by outputting text content.

To create the missing PNG files for the tests, you would need to either:

1. Use actual image files
2. Create empty files with PNG extension that the tests might accept
3. Use a tool that can generate placeholder PNG files

Would you like me to help you with an alternative approach to fix the failing tests?
